## What is Node?
----------------
Node is a open-source program that provides a run time environment for executing javascript code outside of the browser.
It is single-threaded, asynchronous, event-driven and performs non-blocking I/O.
It is ideal for building highly scalable, data and disk intensive,I/O and real-time application.

### Properties
------------
Since, it is a run-time environment for javascript application so, like javascript it is also having single thread called thread of execution.

- **Single-threaded** : By Single-threaded means Javascript runtime executes only  one piece of code( or statement) at any instance of time synchronously. It has only one call stack and one heap memory.

- **I/O(input/output)** : I/O is the slowest among the fundamental operations of a computer. It involves accessing data on the disk, reading and writing a file, waiting for user input, doing a network call, performing some database operation etc. It adds a delay between the moment the request is sent to the device and the moment the operation completes.



- **Asynchronous** : Since, node is single-threaded, it cannot be used for blocking tasks. For it to be able to do I/O it has to handle things in a asynchronous manner
